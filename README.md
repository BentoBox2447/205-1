Statistical Analysis Expecations: 

Expectations:
• Create compelling visuals that show relationships between variables:
o Continuous variables: scatter plot with trend line/curve
o Categorical variables: contingency table with a visual (see
http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/chi-square-test-of-independence-in-r for some
examples)

• Perform at least three hypothesis tests.
o Use at least two different types of test; at least one must be a chi-square test
o Include a confidence interval in your results for at least two of your tests
o Use appropriate parametric or non-parametric methods depending on the claim you are
investigating, variable type (categorical, quantitative), and test assumptions
o Randomized simulation may be used when appropriate but is not required
o Give a 1-3 sentence explanation of your results for each test
• OPTIONAL: Use machine learning techniques to make predictions using your data
o Use appropriate ML methods depending on problem type, data, etc.
• Add any necessary text to explain visuals, results, data insights, research question (partial)
answers, etc.
o Text should be limited and in sentence form. No long paragraphs!
