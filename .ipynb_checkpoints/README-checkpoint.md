Statistical Analysis Expecations: 

Expectations:
- Create compelling visuals that show relationships between variables:
- Continuous variables: scatter plot with trend line/curve
- Categorical variables: contingency table with a visual (see http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/chi-square-test-of-independence-in-r for some examples)
- Perform at least three hypothesis tests.  
- Use at least two different types of test; at least one must be a chi-square test  
- Include a confidence interval in your results for at least two of your tests  
- Use appropriate parametric or non-parametric methods depending on the claim you are investigating, variable type (categorical, quantitative), and test assumptions
- Randomized simulation may be used when appropriate but is not required
- Give a 1-3 sentence explanation of your results for each test
 
OPTIONAL: Use machine learning techniques to make predictions using your data
- Use appropriate ML methods depending on problem type, data, etc.
- Add any necessary text to explain visuals, results, data insights, research question (partial) answers, etc.
- Text should be limited and in sentence form. No long paragraphs!
